  # By default, CrewAI will use a default LLM (often OpenAI's GPT models)
  # and will expect the necessary API key (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)
  # to be set as an environment variable.
  # If you want to specify a particular LLM, you can add an 'llm:' block here.
  # For example:
  # llm:
  #   model_name: gpt-4 # or any other model like gemini-pro
  #   # Add other LLM specific parameters here if needed
